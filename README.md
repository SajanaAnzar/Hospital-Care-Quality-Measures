Hospital Care Quality Measures â€“ Machine Learning Project


This project focuses on analyzing and predicting hospital care quality using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Hospital Care Quality Measures dataset, which contains information about different hospitals, their performance measures, and scores.



Key Objectives:
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

Handle missing values and outliers using IQR method.

Visualize score distribution and hospital performance.

Convert score to categorical labels (Very Low to Very High).

Train and evaluate classification models:

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Measure and compare model accuracy.

Provide meaningful visual insights into hospital care quality.



Tools Used:
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn
